Tools: SQL, Power BI

Situation

Optimizing marketing spend for maximum returns is a very important task for effective growth. The older marketing dashboard lacked consistent KPI tracking, which made it difficult to track, analyze, and monitor marketing channels and campaign performance.

Task

I was tasked with creating a marketing dashboard involving consistent KPI tracking along with multiple report pages based on executive reporting, marketing channel, and campaign-level performance, along with creative-level analysis.

Action

I collaborated with the marketing team to understand their requirements. Then, cleaned, pre-processed, and modeled data in SQL. After that, connected SQL with Power BI, developing 3 report pages – Executive (Main) Page, Campaign Level Analysis Page, and Creative Level Analysis Page using relevant KPIs, visuals, and slicers to slice and dice the data.

Result

The dashboard was developed on time, focusing on key metrics and KPIs relevant to each report page scope.

It demonstrated how each marketing channel, campaign, objective, targeting type, and creative is performing based on the benchmark.

It also focuses on clearly defining best marketing channels, campaigns, and creative types based on dynamic slicing for the marketing team to make actionable decisions.

Some Quantifiable Achievement:

    Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing $42M in marketing revenue, 614M impressions, and 1M conversions across 8+ platforms, enabling data-driven decisions at the platform, campaign, and creative levels.

    Automated KPI calculations for ROI (226.77), ROAS (3.27), ARPC ($30.74), CTR (2.74%), CPC ($0.77), and CPM ($20.98), reducing weekly reporting time by ~60%.

    Identified top performers: TikTok Ads ROI 245.48 (+8.25% vs overall), Campaign Q21 ROI 296.30 (+30.66%), Image creatives CTR +1.03%, and “Sign Up” CTAs CTR +2.23%.

    Created three-tier analysis structure (Main, Campaign Level, Creative Level) with slicers for platform, campaign, region, creative type, and objective, allowing instant deep dives for executives.
    Pinpointed underperforming channels (e.g, Reddit Ads ROI 205.46) vs. top performers, driving strategic budget reallocations that improved ROI by ~15%.
